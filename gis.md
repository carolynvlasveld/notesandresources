Questions/revisions: how does a raster tiff, etc, 'know' where it goes in the map? If it's just a simple bunch of pixels, where is the information storeed in the tiff file telling it where (i.e.,m the coords) it belongs on a map?

Shape'files' should have at least 3 files ot them: .shp (main shapefile), .shx, and .dbf (attrivbute table-can be opened in excel/calc/etc). if .prj file is there, it will have projection info for the layer
