Ecology skills:\
🔸[Getting experience as a budding botanist/ecologist](https://github.com/carolynvlasveld/notesandresources/blob/main/ecologyexp.md)

Botany:\
🔸[Checklist of 2733 extant and accepted Tasmanian vascular plants](https://github.com/carolynvlasveld/notesandresources/blob/main/tasvasc2024list.csv) filtered from the 2024 [Census of the Vascular Plants of Tasmania](https://flora.tmag.tas.gov.au/resources/census/). I use this to keep track of how many plants I've identified so far. Feel free to use and cite the original census.
